As a Fishmonger at Whole Foods in Glastonbury, CT, I am dedicated to providing our customers with the finest selection of sustainable and responsibly sourced seafood. With a deep passion for the ocean and a commitment to quality, I strive to deliver an exceptional seafood experience for every customer.

One of my primary responsibilities is to ensure that our seafood counter is always stocked with the freshest fish, shellfish, and other seafood products. I work closely with our trusted suppliers, who share our commitment to sustainability, to source the highest quality seafood available. By maintaining strong relationships with these suppliers, I can guarantee that we consistently offer a diverse range of seafood options that meet our strict standards for freshness and flavor.

As a Fishmonger, I am not only focused on providing excellent seafood but also on educating our customers about the importance of sustainable fishing practices and the benefits of consuming responsibly sourced seafood. I am always ready to provide information about different fish species, their origins, and the best cooking methods to enhance their natural flavors. Whether customers are looking for a specific type of fish for a special recipe or need guidance on making sustainable choices, I am here to offer expert advice and personalized recommendations.

Food safety is paramount in the seafood department, and I ensure that all seafood products are handled and stored in accordance with the highest hygiene standards. I closely monitor temperature controls, implement proper storage practices, and regularly inspect our inventory to guarantee that our seafood is safe for consumption.

Together, we strive to create an inviting atmosphere where customers feel confident in the quality and sustainability of the seafood they purchase.
